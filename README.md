Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm: The shortest path between each charging station and a given beginning node is determined by applying Dijkstra's algorithm. In order to determine the shortest path to every charging station, the algorithm iteratively updates the shortest paths from the start node to every other node. This procedure is essential for efficiently directing EV consumers to the closest charging station.


Using Dijkstra's algorithm to navigate EV charging stations provides a deep understanding of the possible benefits of algorithmic route planning for sustainable transportation. Our results highlight the practical effectiveness of the algorithm, showing that it may be used to significantly decrease trip durations and, consequently, the energy expense of looking for charging stations.
